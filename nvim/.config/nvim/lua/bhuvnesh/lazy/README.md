1. Today, 19-May-2025, added a lsp_backup file. It has all the customizations
   I did in my LSP configurations. The one in use is the lsp.lua file which has
   the minimum customizations for simplicity.

   Please use lsp.lua, if you ever wanna have the freedom to have all the
   customizations around, lsp_backup is the file you wanna use and uncomment out
   stuff that you wanna integrate.
