1. Today, 19-May-2025, added a lsp_backup file. It has all the customizations
   I did in my LSP configurations. The one in use is the lsp.lua file which has
   the minimum customizations for simplicity.

   Please use lsp.lua, if you ever wanna have the freedom to have all the
   customizations around, lsp_backup is the file you wanna use and uncomment out
   stuff that you wanna integrate.

2. Today, 19-May-2025, deleted alot of unused plugins, and kept only those which
   I use most of the times in my workflow. Add some change in the lsp settings as
   well (nvim-lspconfig) to have it triggered only on certain events to have better
   start up time.
